# Technical Q&A Guide

## Authentication & Security
Q: "How do you handle authentication in your application?"
A: "I implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. The tokens are stored securely in HTTP-only cookies, and I use middleware to verify permissions for protected routes."

Q: "How do you ensure your application is secure?"
A: "I implemented several security measures:
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. CORS configuration
3. Rate limiting
4. Secure password hashing
5. Environment variable management"

## System Design & Architecture
Q: "How would you scale this application?"
A: "I would implement:
1. Horizontal scaling with load balancers
2. Database sharding
3. Caching with Redis
4. CDN for static assets
5. Microservices architecture for specific features"

## Performance & Scalability
Q: "How do you handle performance optimization?"
A: "I implemented several optimizations:
1. Code splitting and lazy loading
2. Database query optimization
3. Caching strategies
4. Image optimization
5. Bundle size reduction"
